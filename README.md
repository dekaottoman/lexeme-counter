# lexeme-counter
A lexeme counter I have developed alongside my partners for " CSE0405 - Programming Languages ".

The project was meant to analyze lexemes in a given sample of C++ code. 
The project assumes that in the given sample:
-There are no errors.
-There is a ' ' between each lexeme.
The project will ask for a directory and analyze each file in that directory as asked in the project requirements

NOTE : The project uses the "dirent.h" header which is not supported by VC++ compiler. Please try to use GCC or another that supports it.

Please read the output.pdf to see what the output will look like.
